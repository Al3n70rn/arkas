Description: Artemis was the hunting companion of Kallisto.  This package wraps
             various aspects of workflow automation (assembling transcriptomes, 
             hashing indices after they have been built, checking versions, and
             generally avoiding annoyance factors) useful in the day-to-day
             operation of a transcriptome aligner or pseudoaligner. 
             Tools for data extraction and (progressive) annotation of combined
             or individual transcriptomes, quality control and normalization
             (ERCC control plots and RUVSeq normalization), interpretation
             (gene-level, transcript-level, pathway- and network-level output), 
             guidelines for validation (sample size estimation by simulation),
             and interactions with cloud computing services such as BaseSpace
             are loosely coupled within the default package workflow.
             Please be aware that, while Artemis is licensed under the GPL,
             Kallisto itself is free FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USAGE ONLY. For-profit 
             use of Kallisto requires a licensing agreement executed with the 
             Regents of the University of California. Kallisto is not included 
             within this package; Artemis assumes it is in the user's PATH.
             Artemis' component parts are not restricted in this fashion 
             (although we cannot guarantee that all [pseudo]aligners will 
             necessarily work as well as Kallisto in end-to-end pipelines), and
             most downstream analyses can proceed from any SummarizedExperiment.
             Artemis' annotation functions, in particular, can greatly ease data
             integration, as when comparing in-house results to those of major 
             genome and transcriptome sequencing projects such as TCGA and ICGC.
             Sample size estimates and pathway analyses are similarly decoupled 
             from the underlying source of transcript abundance estimates.
