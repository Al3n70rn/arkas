ERCC_annotated          ERCC spike-in control annotations
KallistoExperiment      Initializes a KallistoExperiment and performs
                        some rudimentary checks. Many of the arguments
                        CAN be NULL; determination of which is required
                        is done at run-time.  A KallistoExperiment must
                        contain at least the est_counts and eff_length
                        assays, because these are required for tpm
                        estimates.  HOWEVER, given raw counts along
                        with informative lengths for each feature
                        (row), we can deduce the effective length of
                        each transcript or bundle from the total
                        normalized count. Function SEtoKE(), which
                        underlies as(SE, "KallistoExperiment"), does
                        exactly that.
KallistoExperiment-class
                        A SummarizedExperiment subclass that stores
                        multiple Kallisto runs
SEtoKE                  Convert a properly annotated
                        SummarizedExperiment with 'counts', OR a matrix
                        of counts and a GRanges of annotations for each
                        count, to a KallistoExperiment (thereby
                        providing tpm estimates on demand).
annotateFeatures        annotate features (genes or transcripts)
                        against (say) EnsemblDb this is becoming the
                        default dispatcher for almost all annotation
artemis-package         various utility functions for fast, informative
                        RNAseq analysis
collapseBundles         Collapse bundles of transcripts, discard any
                        that represent pointless tests, and optionally
                        prune any whose joined bundle IDs tend to choke
                        downstream packages for e.g. pathway- or
                        network-based enrichment analysis.  Note that
                        this function may or may not be optimal for
                        your RNAseq experiment. Please refer to
                        'Details' for some thought exercises about the
                        nature of 'genes'.
collapseTpm             Collapse bundles of transcripts, discard any
                        with (default) < 1TPM/bundle, and optionally
                        prune any whose joined bundle IDs tend to choke
                        downstream packages for e.g. pathway- or
                        network-based enrichment analysis.  Note that
                        this function may or may not be optimal for
                        your RNAseq experiment. Please refer to
                        'Details' for some thought exercises about the
                        nature of 'genes'.
collapseTranscripts     Collapse transcripts, discarding any with low
                        reads (pointless to test them) Filtering
                        usually increases statistical power for given
                        false-positive rate; see Bourgon et al, 2010,
